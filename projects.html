      <h1>a-MAZE-athon</h1>
      <p>Through the <a href="http://www.bootstrapworld.org/">Bootstrap program</a>,
        I created a maze game using Scheme, a variation of the programming language
        Lisp. At the week-long programming workshop held at Google, I learned a lot
        about working with different graphical elements and proper design procedures.

      <p>A live demo is embedded below. You can find and edit your own version
        of the game <a href="http://bit.ly/1PgugwO">here</a>.

      <h1>COSMOS Summer Program</h1>
      <p><a href="https://cosmos-ucop.ucdavis.edu/"><b>COSMOS</b></a> is the California
        State Summer School for Mathematics and Science. I spent a month at the UC
        Santa Cruz campus <a href="http://pages.citebite.com/a3c6x3m0d6bon">as a part
        of the "Video Game Design" cluster of the program</a>. There, I worked with
        Processing, a language similar to Java; Unity, a 3D game design software;
        and GameMaker, a block-by-block programming tool similar to AppInventor.
      </p>
      <p>The first project I developed was an RPG (role-playing game) that involved
        space-bar-shooter mechanisms and keyboard movements. The game was created
        using GameMaker, and modeled an airplane shooter game.
      </p>
      <p>I also developed several games using Processing. One of the programs I
        created demonstrated the principle of <i>flocking</i>, or eventual grouping
        of objects. Another game followed a <i>Hunger Games</i> theme, and merged
        narrative and ludic (gameplay) elements to carry the player through the
        game and to the final objective. The mechanisms included using the arrow
        keys to move around the screen, and using the space bar to shoot.

      <p>The final project for the COSMOS program involved 3D video game design.
        Working in a team of 4, I created a game in which
        <a href="http://bit.ly/1OnhyPs">the central character is a humanoid that
        is trying to discover clues to its identity</a>. Similar to the <i>Hunger
        Games</i> Processing game that I developed, the 3D game merged narrative
        elements with the traditional gameplay, to create a unique user experience.

      <p>For my Introduction to Java course, I developed a chemistry game for my
        final project. The game helps students learn the names of different polyatomic
        ions by collecting falling ions and then putting them together according to
        a "chemical recipe."
      </p>
      <p>The chemistry game, called iCHeF, is similar to another game I developed
        as part of a team for the 2012 Technovation Challenge. The game that my
        team developed won 2nd place at the regional level.
